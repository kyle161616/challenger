## Main mission was to make the html code semantic format.

acomplished the mission by cutting out almost all the Div tags and replaced them with unique readable tags such as section or article or header.

### side mission was to make acessable code

I accomplished making it accessible by using a reset.css file so it creates a baseline for the code
